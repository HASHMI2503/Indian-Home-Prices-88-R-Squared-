## Summary

1. **Data Import and Cleaning:**
   - Imported the dataset and converted the 'number of bathrooms' column to an integer type.
   - Dropped the 'id' column for simplicity.

2. **PCA on Numeric Columns:**
   - Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to numeric columns, excluding 'date' and the output column ('price').

3. **Two Experimental Paths:**
   - **Path 1:** Conducted analysis on all columns using PyForest for automatic feature selection.
   - **Path 2:** Removed columns with low PCA variance to reduce complexity, resulting in a similar model performance but with reduced time complexity.

5. ***Conclusion***

- The models were evaluated using LazyRegressor to compare their performance on two different paths.
- Path 1: All columns included.
- Path 2: Removed some columns with low PCA to reduce complexity.

- **Top 5 Models (Path 1):**
    1. HistGradientBoostingRegressor
    2. XGBRegressor
    3. LGBMRegressor
    4. GradientBoostingRegressor
    5. RandomForestRegressor

- **Top 5 Models (Path 2):**
    1. HistGradientBoostingRegressor
    2. LGBMRegressor
    3. XGBRegressor
    4. RandomForestRegressor
    5. BaggingRegressor
    
    
   **Key Findings:**
   - The model performances between Path 1 and Path 2 are comparable.
   - Path 2, with reduced columns, exhibits reduced time complexity (In some models).
